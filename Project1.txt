#Description
Explore alternative models that are simpler than GPT 3.5 for context-based question answering and assess their suitability for the task.

#Goals
 Research and identify simpler models that can be used for context-based question answering
 Evaluate the performance and capabilities of the identified models
 Determine the feasibility of using simpler models as an alternative to GPT 3.5 for the given task
Expected Outcome
By exploring simpler models for context-based question answering, you can identify alternatives that may be more lightweight and efficient compared to GPT 3.5. This evaluation will help determine the feasibility of using simpler models while still achieving satisfactory performance in answering questions based on provided context.

#Acceptance Criteria
 Research is conducted to identify simpler models suitable for context-based question answering
 The performance and capabilities of the identified models are evaluated
 A comparison is made between GPT 3.5 and the simpler models in terms of suitability for the given task
